# Chill the Lion 🦁

Welcome to **Chill the Lion** — a playful interactive 3D web experience where you can help a lion relax by making the wind blow! Built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/), this project is a fun demonstration of 3D graphics, animation, and user interaction in the browser.

## 🌬️ What is it?
Chill the Lion is a browser-based 3D scene featuring a stylized lion. You can "make wind" by pressing and dragging your mouse (or using touch on mobile), and watch as the lion responds with delight. The project is a great starting point for learning about 3D graphics, creative coding, and interactive web design.
